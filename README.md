# Quiz App

This app is a simple trivia game for iOS that was created as project #2 of the Treehouse iOS Techdegree, the app allows you to answer trivia questions and see whether your answer was right or wrong. In addition, there is a limit of 15 seconds per question and your final score is displayed at the end.

## Project Instructions
You are being given a simple true/false quiz app. The app functions correctly, though much of the code could benefit from major refactoring. For instance, the app currently is based on collection types, which should be converted into custom classes or structs. Similarly, the app does not adhere to the Model-View-Controller design pattern as well as it could.

Additionally, you will need to add several of the features described below, some being mandatory, others optional. For a few of the features, you are being asked to step beyond what you have learned in this course and make use of documentation and outside resources. That said, provided you find the correct resources, you should be able to work through the implementation. Remember, just as important as practicing the specifics of the syntax you’ve learned is getting comfortable with the idea of venturing into the unknown to find and use the right tools for the job.

It is worth noting that while we have provided a final question set and UI screenshots, we encourage you to choose a subject area that interests you (movies, sports, history, technology, etc…) and create your own question set and background imagery/UI to match. This is not a requirement for the project, but will almost certainly make it a more enjoyable experience and better portfolio piece.
